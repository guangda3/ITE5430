# My Biography

## About Me

My name is Guangda Tang, and my friends usually just refer me as 'Tang'. 

Unfortunately, I **DO NOT** have any IT-related background because I gained my Bachelor Degree in Liberal Art. 

I've been exposed to a wide range of subjects during my undergraduate studies: Social and Behavioral Sciences, International Studies, Humanity, Economics and more.

After graduating from my university, I wanted to explore another alternative career path in the booming technology field. I did my research and found out that the ITS program at Humber does **NOT**
require any undergraduate background. That's why I'm here at Humber even though I don't process any IT background. 

*However*, I don't think I'm lack of confidence when being compared to other experienced developers. They surely know more but I have great passion and desire to learn and practice more.

I have been studying at the most popular languages: 
*JAVA 
*C# 
*Javascript 
*PHP 
*Swift

So far, I have successfully finished several light-weight projects with my groups and I really learned a lot.

I’m particularly interested in Java and currently doing a Java capstone project. Yet I’m always ready to learn other new technologies!

### About my working environment

I have a MacBook, but it has two OS: Mac OS and WIN10, as I installed WIN10 by *Boot Camp*. But I prefer using **WIN10** as my primary operating system.
